Zotero scipts and custom modifications to existing Zotero components

Currently, just some translators to help Zotero work with BibTeX the way I want.  These can be copied / moved directly into the `translators` folder within your [Zotero Data Folder](http://www.zotero.org/support/zotero_data).

There is also a branch with some early ideas for a plugin to add undo functionality to Zotero. Very early stages.
